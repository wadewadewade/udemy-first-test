                Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
            </h2>

                So, how 'bout them Knicks? Bender?! You stole the atom. Shut up and get to the point! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
            </p>
            <p>
                As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! With gusto. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". I never loved you. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Why did you bring us here?
            </p>

                Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

                You mean while I'm sleeping in it? When will that be? Shinier than yours, meatbag. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?                
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! I wish! It's a nickel. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!                
            </p>
            <p>
                But I've never been to the moon! Tell her she looks thin. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Hey, guess what you're accessories to. No, she'll probably make me do it. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!
